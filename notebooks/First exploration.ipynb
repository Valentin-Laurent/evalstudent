Phones have went from something you use to just call people, too your very personal computer, up to date will all the new software to make surfing the internet easier. Now, that sounds wonderful but these thing can also so be a huge distraction to many. Especially when they are being used while operating a motor vehicle.<br><br></span>|<span style='color:DarkRed'>For one thing, using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions.</span>|<span style='color:Blue'> It is easily possible for your eyes tom slip off the road. The Tampa Bay Times claim that it \"takes seconds to get your eyes off the road and into a car accident\". Therefore, instead of your eyes being locked into your phone, they should be focusing in on your speed, the road, and the traffic. At the same time, your mind can only process so much. According to Goldsborough \"the human mind is not capable of texting and driving\". Other people have also confirmed that \" driving is a one mind chore\" meaning that the mind cannot to both at the same time. In addition, your mind need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Thus, concentration is important while driving and breaking that concentration causes a risk for an accident.<br></span>|<span style='color:DarkRed'><br>Secondly, texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well. </span>|<span style='color:Blue'>Texting while driving can limit your response time to something like a car pulling out in front of you, a child or adult walking in front of you, and other things. Texting someone means that you have to put all of your attention into what you are texting which, so if you are driving and texting at the same time you are bound to miss something that you should have been paying attention too or you can hit something that you should have been paying attention too, like a car, animal or even worse a person. A article called \"Texting While Driving\" states that texting and driving has become a \"prominent social issue, and it's the most hazardous practice that risks accidents to drivers, cyclists and pedestrians\". A pedestrian can walk onto the road at anytime but it is up to the driver to pay attention to road and avoid endangering his/her and the pedestrian life.<br><br></span>|<span style='color:DarkRed'>Finally, the numbers speak for themselves, too many accidents have occurred as a result of people texting and driving. </span>|<span style='color:Blue'>People's lives will always be endangered if people feel like the best time to call their mom or girlfriend is when they are driving. I</span>|<span style='color:YellowGreen'>If we can just wait until we arrive at our destination before having to pick up the phone while driving then we can avoid a lot more accidents and more lives will be spared. </span>|<span style='color:Green'>Remember, think before you pull out your phone to text someone while driving because life is to precious and short enough already.   </span>"

They really help students to not forget about what they are learning about. In the summer time, students tend to take their whole mind off school because there is no work to do, but if they have a project to do, its easier to keep your mind on the subject your learning. </span> | <span style='color:DarkRed'>If the teacher was the creator of the project, it would be so much more straight forward and exactly on the topic that he or she was going for. </span> | <span style='color:Blue'>The reason why it wouldn't be a good idea for a student to create the project is because it may not be what the teacher wants us to learn, for example, if we are going to read a summer book, and then write a summary on the book; the student can choose a book that: they already read, a very short book, or a book that has nothing to do with the topics they learned about. If the teacher assigned the book, She would let them read and study a book she thinks is best for what they learned over the year.\n",
       "</span> | <span style='color:DarkRed'>They have more knowledge about the topic </span> | <span style='color:Blue'>For example, my history teacher gave us a project to do on world war II, and we had the choice to either create the project ourselves, or for the teacher to design it for us. We had one week to decide either or not we should design it or not, so we made a chart. The outcome of this chart should us that it would be best if the teacher designed it for us. The reasons for letting our teacher design for us was: the teacher is gonna be grading it so we want to know how to do it right, if we were the ones to design the project, and everyone in the class has a different subject, then it would be very confusing on the teacher to grade or talk about in class when we come back in the summer.\n",
       "</span> | <span style='color:MediumVioletRed'>The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students.</span> | <span style='color:MediumPurple'>The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made.</span> | <span style='color:Blue'>I think the best way to handle this situation is if the teacher gave the students a specific topic and specific rules to the project. In that case the student can be creative but at the same time, the teacher would be able to grade it and talk about it in the class for everyone to listen, because everyone's project would be on the same subject.</span> | <span style='color:Green'>the teacher should design the project because, it would give the student a better understanding on the subject that the class is learning about. Students would have a broader thought about what they learned about in that class. They would not forget about what they learned, and they would keep it in mind through out the whole year. It is honestly hard to remember everything you learned during the year, so summer projects are great for students, if the teacher was the one who designed it</span> | "
