Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles dont control us.

Generic_Name's mom took her friends advice because, she felt like that was the best for her and Generic_Name. Finally, people also take advice from other people too see if they can find a better solution or advice. For example, Generic_Name is an actress she loves too act, but everywhere she goes theres always people taking pictures or videos of her. She was getting so annoyed by these people, and it got to the point where she stopped going out. Her producer told her that she should just tell them to go away, or get body guards.

NASA are thinking about sending a human to study in Venus. Temperature will still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. NOt easy condifitons, but survivable for humes. The researcher can't take a sample rock, gas or anything else, from the distance. so they need to get up close and personal despite the risk or they try to think that as a challlenges/ Many researcher are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. </Evidence> <Claim style='padding: 2px'>NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. </Claim> <Evidence style='padding: 2px'>Another project is looking back to an old technology called Mechanical COmputers.
