# Introduction
Exploratory notebooks and utils related to the [Feedback Prize - Evaluating Student Writing](https://kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021) Kaggle competition.

We scored a decent top 44% on the private leaderboard, with our team "Wagon Bar" :)

A lot of our work (notebooks and datasets) is currently private on Kaggle, including our final inference notebook. We plan to add it here soon.

# Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{group}/evaluating-student-writing.git
