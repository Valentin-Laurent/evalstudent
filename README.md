# Introduction
Exploratory notebooks and utils related to the [Feedback Prize - Evaluating Student Writing](https://kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021) Kaggle competition.

We scored a decent top 44% on the private leaderboard, with our team "Wagon Bar" :) Our final inference notebook is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/valentinlaurent2/two-longformers-inference)

A lot of our work (notebooks and datasets) is still currently private on Kaggle, but we plan to add it here soon.
